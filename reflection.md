This assignment I am able to better understand a bit about what was wanted. Looking at the specific methods I see that there are easier/cleaner ways I could have gone about doing the assignment. For example, the int indexOf(String) method yours was very simple and straightforward and mine was not. It is methods like those where I need to do more studying and practice how to make my code more clean instead of messy and all over the place. It does however, compile as it should and work properly. I am also made sure to read over the pact again and make sure that I was following all of the rules. Some github wont sync my changes though.
